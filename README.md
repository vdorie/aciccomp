aciccomp
 +========
 +
 +Tools and data for the Atlantic Causal Inference Conference Competition.
 +
 +Currently contains data from the 2016 competition in the form an R package (`aciccomp2016`). It can be installed from within R by executing:
 +  
 +    install.packages("devtools")
 +    devtools::install_github("vdorie/aciccomp/2016")
 +
 +The `tools` subdirectory contains scripts that may be of use in fitting a number of methods against a large number of data sets on a cluster and were used to execute the 2017 competition. These will likely require modification, as they are installation dependent.
